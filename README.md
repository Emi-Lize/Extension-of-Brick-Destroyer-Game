## Game Information
A brick destroyer game with 5 levels. To complete a level, all bricks on the screen must be broken. Each level consists of different types of bricks which have different properties. The last level has small yellow squares known as power-ups which increase the chances of breaking the bricks in the level. *Original source code from https://github.com/FilippoRanza/Brick_Destroy.*

## Controls
- A - Move Left
- D - Move Right
- SPACE – Start/Pause the Game
- ESC – Enter/Exit the Pause Menu

## Maintenance
Refactored the original code to enhance maintainability by redistributing methods to enhance single responsibility, reducing code duplication, improving method names, adding JavaDocs for documentation, introducing superclasses for encapsulation, and removing redundant elements. The specific changes are detailed below:
- Separated the classes into different packages
- Moved methods from existing classes to new classes to promote single responsibility
  - `Brick` to `Crack`
  - `Wall` to `GameSystem`
  - `HomeMenu` to `HomeDesign`
  - `GameBoard` to `GameDesign`
  - `GameDesign` to `PauseMenu`
- Split up large methods into smaller methods to promote single responsibility
  - `runGame` in `GameBoard`
  - `initialise` in `HomeMenu`
  - `fontDesign` in `HomeDesign`
- Moved repeated lines of codes to a new method to reduce code duplication
  - `moveBall` in `Ball`
  - `reset` in `GameBoard`
  - `createLevels` in `Wall`
- Methods were renamed to improve clarity on the purpose of the method
  - `moveTo` to `reset` in `Ball` and `Player`
  - `updateBrick` to `drawCrack` in `CementBrick`
  - `makeCrack` to `setCrackPoints` in `Crack`
  - `autoLocate` to `centerBoard` in `GameFrame`
  - `impact` to `hitBall` in `Player`
  - `makeLevels` to `setUpLevels` in `Wall`
- JavaDocs were created to provide information on the methods and classes
- Super classes were created to promote encapsulation
  - `MenuDesign`
  - `MidGameDesign`
- Removed redundant variables and methods

## Extension
Modified and extended the original game by adding more features:
- Added scores to the game which records how long the player takes to complete the game by using `HighScore` and `ScoreDesign` class
- The time taken by the player and the top 5 high scores of the level is displayed after each level is completed
- If the player beats one of the top 5 scores, their score will replace that score and be saved to the score text file
- “NEW HIGHSCORE!” will be displayed next to the score of the player in the list of high scores if the player’s score has been added to it
- Added a new level which consists of a new brick type called Magic Brick and Power-Ups by using `MagicBrick` and `PowerUp` class
- Magic Brick has a strength of two and a probability to have its strength reduced when the ball hits it
- Power-Ups increase the probability of magic brick’s strength reducing by 0.05 for each power-up
- There are only 10 power-ups available in the last level
- Reduced the width of the player bar in the new level by one-third
- Added an info screen to provide information about the game and the game controls by using `Info` and `InfoDesign` class
- Added a background image to the home menu and info screen by using `BackgroundImage` class
